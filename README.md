# üìã To-Do List Console App

This is a simple and interactive To-Do List console application built using C#. It allows you to add, remove, and list tasks, all while saving them to a text file (`tasks.txt`) so that they persist between app sessions. It's perfect for small task management on the go!

## Features
- Add Tasks: Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- Remove Tasks: Remove tasks by selecting their number in the list.
- List Tasks: View all current tasks.
- Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in a text file (`tasks.txt`) so they remain after the application is closed and reopened.
